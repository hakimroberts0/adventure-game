    <h1> PRO BALL</h1>
    <p> You are the coach of a highscool football ball team. In a football game, there is only 30 seconds left in the 4th quarter, the score is 17-14, your team is down. You must decide wether you want to run the ball, pass the ball, or punt the ball. You must get the 1st down to get in feild goal range to take the game into overtime. </p>
    
        <h3>Run th ball</h3>
    
        <h3>Pass the ball</h3>
        You decide to pass the ball. In the huddle th quarter back tells the tightend to run a stick route. The quarter back calls "HUT!". The tightend runs the route and gets wide open. The quarter throws the ball to the tight end, he catches the ball. He is tackled after he gets past the first down markers. You call timeout and decide to kick the field goal. After the feild goal is kicked the score is tied 17-17. Now you have to kick the ball to the opposing team. They catch the ball at the five yard line. The kick returner runs as fast as he can. He gets to the sideline, no one can catch him. He runs the kick back for a touch down and he wins his team the game. And you lose.<a href= "adventuregame.html">Reset</a>

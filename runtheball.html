    <h1> PRO BALL</h1>
    <p> You are the coach of a highscool football ball team. In a football game, there is only 30 seconds left in the 4th quarter, the score is 17-14, your team is down. You must decide wether you want to run the ball, pass the ball, or punt the ball. You must get the 1st down to get in feild goal range to take the game into overtime. </p>
    
    <h3>Run the ball </h3>
    You decide to run the ball. The quarter back breakjs the huddle, the team lines up in the I-formation. The game clock continues to count down. The quarter back yells "HUT!". He hands the ball to the fullback dive. The fullback sees a whole, but the linebacker shoots through the whole, the fullback is stopped before he gets past the first down markers. Your team turns over on downs. The opposing team knels the ball to run out the clock. The game clock hits zero and you lose.
